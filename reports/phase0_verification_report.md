# Phase 0 Verification Report

## Summary
Overall: FAIL

## Branch & PR
- Branch exists and up-to-date: FAIL (phase0-bootstrap branch not found; repository only has local branch `work`.)
- PR "Phase 0: Audit & Bootstrap" open: FAIL (no remote configured; cannot locate PR.)

## Required Files
- ci.yml: PASS (path: .github/workflows/ci.yml)
- dependabot.yml: PASS
- pull_request_template.md: PASS
- CODEOWNERS: PASS
- CONTRIBUTING.md: PASS
- CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md: PASS
- SECURITY.md: PASS
- pyproject.toml: PASS
- .pre-commit-config.yaml: PASS
- pytest.ini: PASS
- Makefile/justfile: PASS (Makefile present)
- docs/DEV_SETUP.md: PASS
- .env.example: PASS
- backend/tests/test_health.py: PASS
- /health route present & non-breaking: PASS (FastAPI router returns {"status": "ok"}).

## Tooling & Gates
- pre-commit hooks (Ruff/Black/isort/mypy/...): PASS (includes end-of-file-fixer, trailing-whitespace, check-yaml, detect-private-key, black, isort, ruff, ruff-format, mypy.)
- Python version pinned (>=3.11): PASS (pyproject.toml requires-python = ">=3.11,<3.13").
- Pytest coverage flags present: PASS (pytest.ini addopts include coverage for backend with term-missing report.)
- CI triggers & matrix correct: PASS (CI runs on pull_request and non-main pushes with Python 3.11 & 3.12 matrix and lint/type/test steps.)
- Dependabot weekly (pip & actions): PASS (weekly schedule configured for pip and github-actions ecosystems.)

## Security & DX
- .env.example safe (no secrets): PASS (uses placeholder values like `changeme`.)
- DEV_SETUP.md reproducible: PASS (documents bootstrap commands for macOS/Linux/Windows.)
- SECURITY.md present & useful: PASS (documents disclosure email and response expectations.)
- CODEOWNERS default owner set: PASS (wildcard assigned to @hambonesoftware.)

## Local Execution Logs
- pre-commit run: FAIL (dependencies unavailable because `uv sync` could not download packages.)
- pytest: FAIL (not executed; bootstrap failed.)
- Coverage: N/A (bootstrap failure blocked tests)
- /health test: FAIL (blocked by dependency installation failure.)

## CORS Configuration
- Reads ALLOW_ORIGINS env: PASS (Settings.ALLOW_ORIGINS parses env with default ["http://localhost:3000"].)
- Sends Access-Control-Allow-Origin correctly: PASS (FastAPI CORSMiddleware configured; test asserts header when origin allowed.)

## PR/CI Status
- CI checks green on PR: FAIL (no PR available to inspect.)

## Diff (phase0-bootstrap vs main)
- Added files: N/A (cannot diff; missing phase0-bootstrap and main branches.)
- Modified files: N/A

## Risks / Gaps
- Missing phase0-bootstrap branch and associated PR prevents Phase 0 verification from succeeding.
- Local quality gates cannot be verified due to inability to sync dependencies (PyPI connectivity failure).

## Remediation Plan
- Create and push `phase0-bootstrap` branch aligned with `main`; open PR titled "Phase 0: Audit & Bootstrap" including checklist.
- Ensure repository access to package index (or pre-populate lockfile/vendor packages) so `uv sync` succeeds, then rerun make bootstrap/test and pre-commit hooks.

## One-Shot Repro (from clean clone)
```bash
make bootstrap
pre-commit run --all-files
pytest -q --maxfail=1 --disable-warnings --cov=backend --cov-report=term-missing
```
