2. Email [security@hambonesoftware.com](mailto:security@hambonesoftware.com)
   with detailed reproduction steps, affected endpoints, and potential impact.
3. Expect an acknowledgement within 2 business days.
4. Coordinated disclosure timelines are appreciated; we will keep you informed of
   remediation progress and planned release timing.

Please include any relevant logs, request/response samples, or proof-of-concept
code to help triage the issue quickly. Encrypt sensitive reports if needed.
